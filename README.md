joplin.nvim is a Neovim plugin designed to manage Joplin notes seamlessly from within the editor. It supports multiple Joplin storage backends, including Joplin Server, Dropbox, and Nextcloud, with the goal of providing an intuitive interface for note-taking and management without leaving Neovim.

**This project is a Work in Progress (WIP)**, and new features and backends will be added gradually.

## Features (WIP)
- **Browse Notebooks**: Navigate through your Joplin notebooks and notes.
- **Create, Edit, and Delete Notes**: Perform CRUD operations on your notes.
- **Multi-Backend Support**: Connect to Joplin Server, Dropbox, Nextcloud, or local CLI-based installations.
- **Optional Integration with Other Plugins**: Integrate with plugins like `oil.nvim` for enhanced file management.

## Usage
Use the available commands to start managing your Joplin notes directly from Neovim! This plugin aims to provide a seamless note management experience for users of various Joplin configurations.
